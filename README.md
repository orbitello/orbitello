HI, This is the Github Page for Project Orbitello Participating in the NASA International Space Apps Challenge 2020

Project Orbitello visualizes and explains the problems and turbulence that happens in telecommunications between Earth and Mars in a way where you can earn knowledge about the situation and have fun simultaneously and also have options for astronauts on Mars to browse the internet

Our Challenge: Can You Hear Me Now?
Human missions to Mars are moving from the realm of science fiction to science fact. Your challenge is to design an interactive application to explore the challenge of communicating with astronauts on Mars from Earth.
